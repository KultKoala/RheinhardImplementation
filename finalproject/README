This program implements Rheinard color mapping from one images to another.
This program is run in the form ./rheinard imagename1 imagename2.
In this form if imagename1 and imagename2 are the names of valid images
in the directory then the look and feel of imagename2 will be mapped on to
imagename1 and display in a window.

If one wishes to save the image then one must press 'w' and then enter a
valid image name into the command that launched this program.
